# W3Schools Database in Docker

Forked from https://github.com/AndrejPHP/w3schools-database for academic purposes.

This repository provides:

- a docker compose which sets up the DB on port 3309 (non-default, no clashes)
- initializes the database data from w3schools (provided by @AndrejPHP) 
- Visual Studio Code config

## Setup 

- Setup is as easy as:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

-  Data is stored in the data directory


## Tables

When the docker container starts, it creates database named __w3schools__ with the following tables

    categories
    customers
    employees
    orders
    order_details
    products
    shippers
    suppliers
    
and inserts the respective data. 

## How to reset?

Execute:

```bash
docker compose down
rm -rf data
docker compose up -d
```
